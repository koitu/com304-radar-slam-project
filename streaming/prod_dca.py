    This function is one of the processed called in realtime_streaming.py.
    Paramters:
    - q: Queue to push new data
    - index: dummy index
    - lua_file: lua file containing radar chirp paramters

    This function reads data from the ethernet port connected to the radar, reformats the data, and pushes the range fft to q.
    Note: This function can be called in parallel with other functions (see realtime_streaming.py for more details).
